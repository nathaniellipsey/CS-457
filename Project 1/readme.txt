THIS FILE IS DOCUMENTATION FOR PROJECT 1.

================================
Compile Instructions (CMAKE):
NOTE: CMAKE is required to generate a MAKEFILE using the CMakeLists.txt
If you are unable to compile the program using CMAKE, send me an email, and I will send you a copy of the program compilable without CMAKE.

1. Decompress the project folder
2. Navigate to FOLDER_NAME/Project1/build
3. Right click, Open Terminal Here
4. Enter the command "cmake .." into the terminal
5. Use the command "make" into the terminal
6. Use the command ./project1 to run the project

NOTE: If you get an error saying that the current cmake cache is different, delete the build folder, make a new folder of the same name, then try again.

The program has been succesfully re-downloaded and executed with the above instructions. Let me know if you have trouble.
